# ECS171-Final-Project

This project analyzes the performance of various machine learning models for predicting Bitcoin price movements, addressing the lack of standardized testing for crypto trading bots. Four models are implemented and tested—Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Transformer, and Open Source (Neural prophet)—using metrics like MSE, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. Our goal is to help traders and researchers identify the most effective models for different market conditions and improve crypto trading strategies.
